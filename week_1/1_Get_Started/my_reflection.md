## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

# Biggest problem I had was finding the right way to download the software.  When I tried to use my terminal, I would recieve error messages.

#Git is a tool that allows people to follow the progress/changes in programing code, while GitHub is a host site that stores programing codes that people can access and edit remotely.

#Version Control keeps track of changes to a collaborated file and shows who made the changes to that file. GitHub keeps a timelog of all changes, and uses a distributed repository that allows for multiple people to access a file at the same time.

#I plan on using Git because it is a Version Control that minimizes collaboration issues.  As a distributed repository contol system, you have a complete history of all changes and who made them, as well giving each user a complete copy of the repo. (which allows for everyone to keep working even if the server with the original shut down)

#The only real problem I had was trying to create a file within a repository.  My terminal would not allow me to do so, but I found on the internet that it was because I was using 'bash' and I needed to change my syntax.  Once I figured out how to create files I was able to use my terminal to stage and commit changes.
