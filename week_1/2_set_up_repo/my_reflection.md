#To create a repository on GitHub, that you can clone to your local computer, you must log into your GitHub account, using your username.  Fill out the new repository form.  Name the reposity [username].github.io  and make sure that the repository is made public! Then create the repository.  Next open your GitHub application on your local computer.  Go to the repository section.  Select your GitHub username.  Find the repository named [username].github.io, and click the buttom that says 'clone to computer'.

#Open source means the programer has shared the code to a computer program, allowing anyone to edit the code.

#I like that anyone can help someone who is writting an open source program.  The problem is if someone was working on something brilliant, open sources allows everyone the oppurtunity to 'steal' his/her idea.  I think if human nature was more generous open source would be a utopia.

#This was the first time I was able to clone a repository.  I had tried to do so from my terminal, but was unable.

#This topic was very straight forward.  I did not need extra help.
