# I asked a lot of syntax questions during this challenge.  I would use youtube videos to anwser what questions were not anwsered in the reading.
# I am still having trouble with my positioning.  I understand how it should work, I just can't get it to work properly for me.  My roommate is going to school for computer sciences and I am going to ask him what I am doing wrong, when he gets back from vacation.
#Everything I learned to complete this challenge was new to me.  I learned it all in the previous lessons.
#I am pretty confident I understand all the Learning Competencies.
#I enjoy making small adjustments and watching how much they change the entire project.
#All of the process is tedious, but it doesn't come with the negative connotation of the word.
