# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.


<!-- DOM is not a programing language. API (web or XML page)= DOM + JS(scripting language).  DOM allows you to find and change elements in a HTML site, in real time.  I like how easy it is find what each part of the script does, by highlighting it on the page in front of you.  I do not like how easy it makes it seem to change a website.  I feel like that is a trick! Haha 

My site was much more simple.  The wordpress.com site sources were much more detailed, and better writen!

I liked using Chrome Web Tools a lot.  I have used it for each assigment since I learned about it.  I also showed my roommate who is a CS major and he has started using it.

This was all very straight forward
