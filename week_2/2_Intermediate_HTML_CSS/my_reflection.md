# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Web standards are good.  The allow for programers to write basic script that follows a formula.

Standard structure makes sense.  If you open something you have to close it.  If you want flow then you have to define your classes and elements.

The more I work with HTML5 the more I like it.  Being able to navigate throughouth the page and to put headers and footers for each of my classes (sidebars, body paragraphs) will come in handy.

Reset CSS allows you to see all the styling that you have done to your HTML.  It shows you the backbone of the website.

I use Safari and Chrome.  For the most part websites look the same.  I think there should be a more universal way of having browsers read sites, but my knoweledge on the subject is too limited to explain why or how they should go about doing so.
