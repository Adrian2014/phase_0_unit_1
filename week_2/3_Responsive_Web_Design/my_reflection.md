# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.


Responsive Web design, allows for a webpage to be dispayed on any device at any pixel size.  I think it is a great practice, because you are able to write code for just one website (instead of having to write code for a mobile site, and a tablet site)

They say that in the future the majority of people will use tablets and smartphones to access the internet, so technology is going to revolve around mobile devices and not desktops.

The visually impaired do currently use the internet.  I have a friend who uses Siri, to look things up for him.  He is not completely blind, but he is bad enough that he is not allowed to drive.  He gets very frustrated with Siri's lack of understanding, but I think thats the direction technology is taking.

I like the idea of only having to write script for one site.  It allows all readers, weither on a desktop or mobile device, to access the same page, and get the same information.
