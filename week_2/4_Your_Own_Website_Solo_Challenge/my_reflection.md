* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?

I learned about how people normally read a webpage.  Put the most important stuff at the top left!  Users want to have an intuitive experience and it is up to us to makek it flow properly.

I did like it!  I just wish I was better at it.  I did not have the time to put in this week to give it all that it deserves, but I think its a logical progression for our learning and skills.

I wanted to make a site that highlightes who I was, my work, and a random fact or two.  I also wanted to add page jumps at the bottom and top of the page, and I wanted the page to be somewhat responsive.

I would like to add a couple more sidebars, and maybe a gif or a video.

The most difficult part was getting the page to be responsive.  As soon as I got it working I had an "AHA!!!" moment at 3AM last night, and it was a glorious feeling.


I used several dif. outside sources.  Most of which were Youtube videos.
