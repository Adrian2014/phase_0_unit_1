# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
* How will you combat that? 
* What techniques will you try?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

This has been a rough week for me.  I started a new job that I thought would be part time and ended up taking over 50+ hours this week.  I made it clear that this would be the only week I could work that much.  From now on I will have mondays and fridays off, which should be plenty of time to complete all my assignments. 

In order to help with stress I have meditated.  Like James said, it helped with how I was feeling, but the exhaustion was still there. 

My plan for the rest of Phase 0 is to work on DBC every monday and friday, and finish the rest on the weekend.  This should allow me a day to learn, a day to complete assignments, and will allow me to review on my down time.
